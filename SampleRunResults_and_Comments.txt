APPLICATION PROTOCOL (first step: request to send a file with a given filename):
-client prepares a FileMetadataObject with the filename it wants to send. 
-client write 4 byte representing the size of the serialized Object, then write the Object (FileMetadata)

-server receives a connection for each client.
-server process the handleRead reading the first 4 bytes of the message and then read a serialized JavaObject from the offset 4 (buffer position after an int value) for the size specified in the read int value.

HERE you can see the mismatch:
-each client ask to send a file with a different filename
-the server receives 2 messages from different clients asking to send the same filename. (look for file 6.zip and 9.zip in the messages received by the server)

!!!! This seems an issue in the management of the request or the buffer pool (if it exists...) !!!
